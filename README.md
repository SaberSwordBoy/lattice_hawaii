# How to Play

*note: only two players are supported as of now*

Run the file called `lattice_cli.py` this is the  *command-line interface* version of the game; as in you play it in your console.
If it looks a little weird, that's because it's been minified to make it smaller and run faster [interested?](https://python-minifier.com/)
